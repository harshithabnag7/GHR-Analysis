### :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Project Overview:**

Led Global Hotels project, applying analytics to enhance revenue management by analyzing key metrics; demonstrated data visualization proficiency with Python, Excel, and Tableau, securing 1st place through collaborative excellence.

### 💡 **Key Insights:**



 * Leisure customers outnumber business customers.
 * Travel Agencies/Tour Operators (TA/TO) are the preferred booking channel.
 * Guests with children prefer meal plans, indicating a potential service enhancement.
 * Bookings tend to be closer to the arrival date, suggesting shorter planning periods.
 * Consider offering corporate discounts based on identified need.

### 📚 Learnings:

 * **Data Cleaning:** Conducted data cleaning, addressing data types, missing values, and duplicates; identified null values in "booking company" and "travel agent" columns, interpreting them as customers opting out; resolved Namibia's country code issue by setting keep_default_na=False.
 * **Data Transformation:** Transformed "Arrival Date" into datetime format, added "Arrival Month" column, calculated length of stay, and strategically segmented 'Market Segment' into 'Business' (Aviation, Corporate, Complementary) and 'Leisure' (Direct, Groups, Offline TA/TO, Online TA) for improved customer categorization.
 * Learned to make business recommendations for hotels and ressorts by conducting a holistic analysis of metrics like ADR and RevPAR, considering market trends, embracing customer segmentation, and staying flexible in pricing strategies.
 * RevPAR is a metric used in the hospitality industry to assess a property's ability to fill its available rooms at an average rate. An increase in a property's RevPAR means that its average room rate or its occupancy rate is improving.
